Packages used in our anaconda virtual enironment are listed in 'environment.yml'.

2. Prepare the data.

Generate the data list and replace the path 'xxxx' in 'data/office-home/*.txt' with your own path.

3. Run our demo code.

The executive command for each domain adaptation (DA) method is shown in 'demo_home_ac.sh'.
Using this script, you can reproduce our results of all these DA methods on the 'A to C' task of Office-home DA benchmark.
