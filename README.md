# Official implementation for **NOUN** and PRONOUN

## [**[TIP-2021] Adversarial Domain Adaptation with Prototype-Based Normalized Output Conditioner**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9611076/)

1. Prepare the running environment.

Packages used in our anaconda virtual environment are listed in 'environment.yml'.

2. Prepare the data.

Download the office-home dataset.
Generate the data list and replace the path 'xxxx' in 'data/office-home/*.txt' with your own path.

3. Run our demo code.

The executive command for each domain adaptation (DA) method is shown in 'demo_home_ac.sh'.
Using this script, you can reproduce our results of all these DA methods on the 'A to C' task of Office-home DA benchmark.
